# `readable-code`

## "Language: PHP"

---

## Learning objectives :computer:

- To be able to make decisions about when and how to refactor less readable code.
- To be able to adhere to known PHP code standards like PSR2.
- To be able to think critically about code principles and not follow them blindly.
This is the repository for the exercise: https://github.com/becodeorg/gnt-yu-3-21/tree/master/Workshops/2.Refactoring-PHP


## The Mission

You try to read into the project, but there's no readme, you see variables like $a or $dontChangeThis and the last developer with project knowledge just left.
For projects with a longer lifespan, focusing on this is always a good idea.
Whatever bugs you spot or changing requirements you'll need to meet, it will allow you to make modifications as easily as possible.

## Must-have features

- Have a look at this code and try to understand what it does.
- Read the following article:
- Jason McCreary on writing clean code
- Do not install PHP codesniffer at this point (yet)
- Have the code follow a consistent writing standard. For now, we'll roll with the widely used PSR2.
- Focus just on what you need for now (functions, variables).
- Use them examples instead of the instructions, they are much easier to use.
- Rewrite the file in a way that would improve readability for you (keep everything to one file). Read below for tips.
- When you are done, discuss your solution in groups of two.

## Tips :wrench:

+ Don't aim for perfect all the time, aim for good enough / continuous improvement. Don't be too harsh on yourself!
+ When refactoring, focus on one section (or one thing) first (e.g. a specific function or clear naming).
+ Work in small steps. Write these as separate todo's if you like. Test after every step and use small commits when you're sure everything still works.
+ When in doubt what approach is better, think "what would help me to understand this quickly if I see it again a year from now".
+ Be critical: if you think a certain tip isn't beneficial to your code, ignore or tweak it.
+ When getting used to a standard, don't jump to auto-rewrites immediately. Get used to write code following the standard yourself first.
